**2. What is the learning rate in neural network training, and why is it important? [CO5]**

**Learning Rate**:
- The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function.
- It determines how much to adjust the weights of the network concerning the gradient of the loss function.

**Importance**:
- **Convergence**: A proper learning rate helps the model converge to a minimum of the loss function efficiently.
- **Training Speed**: A higher learning rate can speed up training but risks overshooting the minimum, while a lower learning rate can be too slow and get stuck in local minima.
- **Stability**: Ensures stable updates to the model parameters, preventing large oscillations.

**3. What is transfer learning, and how is it used to improve the performance of a CNN? [CO6]**

**Transfer Learning**:
- Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset is fine-tuned on a smaller, specific dataset.
- It leverages the knowledge gained from the pre-trained model, allowing the model to learn faster and achieve better performance.

**Improving CNN Performance**:
- **Pre-trained Models**: Use models pre-trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) as a starting point.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model on the target dataset by adjusting the weights slightly to adapt to the new data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use the pre-trained model to extract features from the new dataset and train a new classifier on these features.

**4. Describe the basic architecture of a CNN. [CO4]**

**Basic Architecture of a CNN**:
- **Input Layer**: Takes the input image with dimensions (height, width, channels).
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply convolutional filters to the input, producing feature maps. These layers learn local patterns like edges and textures.
- **Activation Function (ReLU)**: Introduces non-linearity to the model, helping to learn complex patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Perform down-sampling (e.g., max pooling) to reduce the spatial dimensions, retaining important features while reducing computational complexity.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Flatten the feature maps and connect them to the output layer. These layers combine features to make predictions.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final classification or regression output, often with a softmax activation for classification tasks.

**Backpropagation Algorithm**:
- Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training neural networks.

  1. **Forward Pass**: Calculate the output of the neural network for a given input by passing it through the network layers.
  2. **Compute Loss**: Calculate the difference between the predicted output and the actual target using a loss function (e.g., mean squared error).
  3. **Backward Pass**: Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by applying the chain rule. This involves propagating the error backward through the network.
  4. **Weight Update**: Update the weights using gradient descent (or a variant) to minimize the loss function.
  \[
  w_{ij} \leftarrow w_{ij} - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}}
  \]
  where \( w_{ij} \) is the weight from neuron \( i \) to neuron \( j \), \( \eta \) is the learning rate, and \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}} \) is the gradient of the loss with respect to the weight.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
- **Concept**:
  - CNNs are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images.
  - They automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

  1. **Convolutional Layers**: Apply convolutional filters to the input data to produce feature maps. These filters detect local patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.
  2. **Activation Function (ReLU)**: Introduce non-linearity to enable the network to learn complex patterns.
  3. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the most important information (e.g., max pooling).
  4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Flatten the feature maps and connect them to the output layer for making predictions.
  5. **Output Layer**: Provides the final classification or regression output, often using softmax for multi-class classification.
