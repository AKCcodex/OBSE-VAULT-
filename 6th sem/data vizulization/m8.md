#### Short Answer Type Questions
**1. What are animated visualizations, and how do they differ from static visualizations? [CO1]**

**Animated Visualizations**:
- Animated visualizations are dynamic representations of data that incorporate movement or changes over time.
- They differ from static visualizations in that they provide a temporal dimension, allowing viewers to see how data evolves or changes across different periods.

**Differences from Static Visualizations**:
- **Temporal Aspect**: Animated visualizations show changes over time, while static visualizations capture a single snapshot.
- **Engagement**: Animated visualizations are often more engaging and can convey complex trends or patterns more effectively.
- **Interactivity**: They may offer interactive elements, allowing users to control the playback speed or focus on specific time periods.
- **Complexity**: Animated visualizations may require more computational resources and programming expertise to create compared to static visuals.

**2. Discuss some real-world applications where animated visualizations have been instrumental in communicating insights. [C06]**

**Real-World Applications**:
- **Epidemiology**: Animated visualizations of disease spread have been crucial for understanding and responding to outbreaks like COVID-19.
- **Climate Science**: Animated climate models help scientists and policymakers understand the effects of global warming over time.
- **Financial Markets**: Animated stock market charts and heatmaps illustrate market trends and fluctuations, aiding investors in decision-making.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Animated traffic flow visualizations assist urban planners in optimizing transportation systems and alleviating congestion.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Animated weather maps and simulations provide insights into weather patterns and extreme events.
- **Educational Tools**: Animated simulations and educational videos help students grasp complex concepts in subjects like physics and biology.

**3. Name some common file formats used for creating animated visualizations. [CO3]**

**Common File Formats**:
- **GIF**: Graphics Interchange Format, widely used for simple animations and web graphics.
- **MP4**: MPEG-4 Part 14, a standard format for storing video and audio data.
- **WebM**: An open-source format optimized for web use, supported by HTML5.
- **APNG**: Animated Portable Network Graphics, similar to GIF but with support for more colors and transparency.
- **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics, which can include animations using SMIL or JavaScript.
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, often used to store and exchange animated data for web applications.

**4. What are some popular libraries for data visualization in Python? [CO4]**

**Popular Python Libraries for Data Visualization**:
- **Matplotlib**: A versatile plotting library that provides a wide range of plot types and customization options.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn specializes in statistical visualization with attractive default styles.
- **Plotly**: An interactive visualization library that supports a variety of chart types and can be used for web-based dashboards.
- **Bokeh**: A library for creating interactive and web-ready visualizations with a focus on interactivity and performance.
- **Altair**: A declarative statistical visualization library that generates concise, readable code.
- **ggplot**: A Python implementation of the grammar of graphics, inspired by the R package ggplot2.

## Python vs R: A Comparison

Below, you can find a table of differences between R and Python:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**R**|**Python**|
|Purpose|Very popular in academia and research, finance and data science|Well-suited for many programming domains, including data science, web development, software development, and gaming|
|First Release|1993|1991|
|Type of Language|General-purpose programming language|General-purpose programming language|
|Open Source?|Yes|Yes|
|Ecosystem|Nearly 19,000 packages available in the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))|+300,000 available packages in the Python Package Index ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/))|
|Ease of Learning|R is easier to learn when you start out, but gets more difficult when using advanced functionalities.|Python is a beginner-friendly language with English-like syntax.|
|IDE|RStudio. Its interface is organized so that the user can view graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time.|Jupyter Notebooks and its modern version, JupyterLab, and Spyder.|
|Advantages|- Widely considered the best tool for making beautiful graphs and visualizations. <br>- Has many functionalities for data analysis. <br>- Great for statistical analysis.|- General-purpose programming languages are useful beyond just data analysis. <br>- Has gained popularity for its code readability, speed, and many functionalities. . <br>- Has high ease of deployment and reproducibility.|
|Disadvantages|- More difficult to learn for people with no software development background.<br>- Limited user community compared to Python<br>- R is considered a computationally slower language compared to Python, especially if the code is written poorly.<br>- Finding the right library for your task can be tricky, given the high number of packages available in CRAN|- Weak performance with huge amounts of data<br>- Poor memory efficiency<br>- Python doesn’t have as many libraries for data science as R. <br>- Python requires rigorous testing as errors show up in runtime. <br>- Visualizations are more convoluted in Python than in R, and results are not as eye-pleasing or informative.|
