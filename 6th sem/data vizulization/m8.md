#### Short Answer Type Questions

**1. What are animated visualizations, and how do they differ from static visualizations? [CO1]**

**Animated Visualizations**:
- Animated visualizations are dynamic representations of data that incorporate movement or changes over time.
- They differ from static visualizations in that they provide a temporal dimension, allowing viewers to see how data evolves or changes across different periods.

**Differences from Static Visualizations**:
- **Temporal Aspect**: Animated visualizations show changes over time, while static visualizations capture a single snapshot.
- **Engagement**: Animated visualizations are often more engaging and can convey complex trends or patterns more effectively.
- **Interactivity**: They may offer interactive elements, allowing users to control the playback speed or focus on specific time periods.
- **Complexity**: Animated visualizations may require more computational resources and programming expertise to create compared to static visuals.

**2. Discuss some real-world applications where animated visualizations have been instrumental in communicating insights. [C06]**

**Real-World Applications**:
- **Epidemiology**: Animated visualizations of disease spread have been crucial for understanding and responding to outbreaks like COVID-19.
- **Climate Science**: Animated climate models help scientists and policymakers understand the effects of global warming over time.
- **Financial Markets**: Animated stock market charts and heatmaps illustrate market trends and fluctuations, aiding investors in decision-making.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Animated traffic flow visualizations assist urban planners in optimizing transportation systems and alleviating congestion.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Animated weather maps and simulations provide insights into weather patterns and extreme events.
- **Educational Tools**: Animated simulations and educational videos help students grasp complex concepts in subjects like physics and biology.

**3. Name some common file formats used for creating animated visualizations. [CO3]**

**Common File Formats**:
- **GIF**: Graphics Interchange Format, widely used for simple animations and web graphics.
- **MP4**: MPEG-4 Part 14, a standard format for storing video and audio data.
- **WebM**: An open-source format optimized for web use, supported by HTML5.
- **APNG**: Animated Portable Network Graphics, similar to GIF but with support for more colors and transparency.
- **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics, which can include animations using SMIL or JavaScript.
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, often used to store and exchange animated data for web applications.

**4. What are some popular libraries for data visualization in Python? [CO4]**
