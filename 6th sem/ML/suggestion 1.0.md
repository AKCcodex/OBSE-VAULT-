## UNIT â€“ 1

### 1. What is supervised learning? Provide an example.
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. This means that each training example includes input data as well as the corresponding correct output. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be generalized to new, unseen data.

**Example:** 
- **Spam Detection:** In spam detection, the model is trained on emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam." The input is the content of the email, and the output is the label indicating whether it's spam or not. The model learns to classify emails based on these examples.

### 2. What is overfitting in machine learning? How can it be prevented?
Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization to new data. This happens when the model is too complex relative to the amount of training data available.

**Prevention Methods:**
- **Cross-Validation:** Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model performs well on different subsets of the data.
- **Regularization:** Adding a penalty for larger coefficients in the model (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization).
- **Pruning:** Reducing the complexity of decision trees by removing parts that do not provide power in predicting target variables.
- **Simplifying the Model:** Using a less complex model with fewer parameters.
- **Early Stopping:** Halting the training process once performance on a validation set starts to degrade.
- **More Training Data:** Increasing the amount of training data can help the model generalize better.

### 3. Provide a real-world application of reinforcement learning.
Reinforcement learning is used in scenarios where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

**Example:** 
- **Autonomous Driving:** Reinforcement learning is used in self-driving cars where the car (agent) makes decisions based on its environment to navigate from one location to another while avoiding obstacles and following traffic rules, maximizing safety and efficiency.

### 4. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning.
The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept that describes the tradeoff between two sources of error that affect the performance of machine learning models:

- **Bias:** Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause the model to miss relevant relations (underfitting).
- **Variance:** Error due to excessive complexity in the learning algorithm. High variance can cause the model to model the random noise in the training data (overfitting).

**Tradeoff:** A good model finds a balance between bias and variance, aiming to minimize total error.

### 5. Differentiate between training data and testing data.
- **Training Data:** This is the dataset used to train the model, where the model learns from these examples to identify patterns and make predictions.
- **Testing Data:** This is the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the model. It contains new, unseen data that the model did not encounter during training, providing an unbiased assessment of the model's predictive performance.

### 6. How does classical machine learning differ from adaptive machine learning?
- **Classical Machine Learning:** Typically involves training a model on a fixed dataset and then deploying the model to make predictions on new data. The model parameters remain static after training.
- **Adaptive Machine Learning:** Involves models that can adapt to new data in real-time. These models continuously learn and update their parameters as they receive new data, making them more flexible and responsive to changes in the environment.

### 7. Define transfer learning and illustrate its importance in machine learning.
**Transfer Learning:** A technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset is used as the starting point for a model on a new, related task. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from the pre-trained model to improve learning efficiency and performance on the new task.

**Importance:** 
- **Reduces Training Time:** Requires less data and computational resources since the model starts from a point of partial knowledge.
- **Improves Performance:** Often achieves better performance on the new task because the pre-trained model has already learned useful features.
- **Useful in Domains with Limited Data:** Particularly beneficial when the new task has limited labeled data.

### 8. Define semi-supervised learning with an example.
**Semi-Supervised Learning:** A learning approach that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. This is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

**Example:**
- **Image Classification:** In an image classification task, you might have a few labeled images (e.g., labeled as cats or dogs) and a large collection of unlabeled images. The model uses the labeled data to learn initial patterns and then leverages the unlabeled data to improve its understanding and accuracy.

### 9. Give an example where the median is a better measure than the mean.
The median is a better measure than the mean in situations where the data contains outliers or is skewed.

**Example:**
- **Income Distribution:** In a dataset of incomes, a few extremely high salaries can skew the mean, giving a distorted view of the typical income. The median, being the middle value, provides a better representation of the central tendency of the majority of incomes.

### 10. What is an imbalanced dataset and how can one deal with this problem?
An imbalanced dataset occurs when the classes in the target variable are not represented equally, with one class being significantly more frequent than the others.

**Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets:**
- **Resampling Techniques:** 
  - **Oversampling:** Increasing the number of instances in the minority class (e.g., using techniques like SMOTE).
  - **Undersampling:** Reducing the number of instances in the majority class.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creating synthetic data points for the minority class.
- **Algorithmic Approaches:** Using algorithms that are robust to class imbalance (e.g., decision trees, ensemble methods).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC instead of accuracy to evaluate model performance.

### 11. What are some ways to make your model more robust to outliers?
- **Robust Algorithms:** Use algorithms less sensitive to outliers, like decision trees and ensemble methods.
- **Data Transformation:** Apply transformations (e.g., log transformation) to reduce the impact of outliers.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and remove or correct outliers before training (e.g., using Z-score, IQR).
- **Robust Loss Functions:** Use loss functions less sensitive to outliers, like Huber loss.
- **Regularization:** Applying regularization techniques to prevent the model from fitting outliers too closely.

### 12. List some ways using which you can reduce overfitting in a model.
- **Cross-Validation:** Ensuring the model generalizes well to different data subsets.
- **Regularization:** Applying L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients.
- **Simplifying the Model:** Reducing the complexity by using fewer parameters or simpler models.
- **Pruning:** Removing unnecessary branches in decision trees.
- **Early Stopping:** Halting training when performance on validation data starts to degrade.
- **More Training Data:** Increasing the amount of training data to improve generalization.
- **Dropout (for Neural Networks):** Randomly dropping units during training to prevent co-adaptation.

### 13. Describe the differences between and use cases for box plots and histograms.
- **Box Plots:** Visualize the distribution of data based on a five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum). They highlight the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers in the data.
  - **Use Cases:** Comparing distributions across different categories or groups, identifying outliers.

- **Histograms:** Display the frequency distribution of a dataset by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. They show the shape of the data distribution.
  - **Use Cases:** Understanding the underlying distribution of continuous data, identifying the mode, skewness, and presence of multiple peaks.

Both box plots and histograms are essential for exploratory data analysis but serve different purposes. Box plots are better for summarizing and comparing distributions, while histograms are more suited for visualizing the distribution's shape and density.
## 1. Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning

### Common Evaluation Metrics:

1. **Accuracy:**
   - **Definition:** The ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
   - **Formula:** \(\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\)
   - **Use Case:** Best used when the classes are balanced.

2. **Precision:**
   - **Definition:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
   - **Formula:** \(\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}\)
   - **Use Case:** Important in scenarios where false positives are costly (e.g., spam detection).

3. **Recall (Sensitivity):**
   - **Definition:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations in the actual class.
   - **Formula:** \(\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}\)
   - **Use Case:** Important in scenarios where false negatives are costly (e.g., disease diagnosis).

4. **F1 Score:**
   - **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - **Formula:** \(\text{F1\ Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}\)
   - **Use Case:** Useful when the dataset has an uneven class distribution.

5. **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve):**
   - **Definition:** A graphical representation of a classifierâ€™s performance across all classification thresholds.
   - **ROC Curve:** Plots TPR (True Positive Rate) against FPR (False Positive Rate).
   - **AUC:** Measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve.
   - **Use Case:** Useful for binary classification problems, especially when the classes are imbalanced.

### Application:
- **Binary Classification:** Metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC are particularly useful.
- **Multi-Class Classification:** Extended metrics like macro/micro-averaged F1 scores can be applied.
- **Imbalanced Data:** Precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC provide better insights than accuracy.

## 4. Karl Pearsonâ€™s Coefficient of Correlation and Covariance Matrix Calculation

### Karl Pearsonâ€™s Coefficient of Correlation:
**Definition:** Measures the linear correlation between two variables \(X\) and \(Y\).

**Formula:** 
\[ r = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}} \]

**Importance:**
- **Quantifies Relationship:** Provides a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship.
- **Standardization:** Normalized between -1 and 1, making it easy to interpret.

### Covariance Matrix Calculation:

Given the data:
\[ \text{Item} \quad X \quad Y \quad Z \]
\[ 1 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 1 \]
\[ 2 \quad -1 \quad 1 \quad 3 \]
\[ 3 \quad 4 \quad 3 \quad -1 \]

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate the mean of \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\):**
   \[ \bar{X} = \frac{1 + (-1) + 4}{3} = 1.33 \]
   \[ \bar{Y} = \frac{2 + 1 + 3}{3} = 2 \]
   \[ \bar{Z} = \frac{1 + 3 - 1}{3} = 1 \]

2. **Create the deviation scores matrix:**
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 - 1.33 & 2 - 2 & 1 - 1 \\
   -1 - 1.33 & 1 - 2 & 3 - 1 \\
   4 - 1.33 & 3 - 2 & -1 - 1 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   -0.33 & 0 & 0 \\
   -2.33 & -1 & 2 \\
   2.67 & 1 & -2 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

3. **Covariance matrix calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Cov}(X, Y, Z) = \frac{1}{n-1} \times \text{deviation scores}^\top \times \text{deviation scores}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   -0.33 & -2.33 & 2.67 \\
   0 & -1 & 1 \\
   0 & 2 & -2
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   -0.33 & 0 & 0 \\
   -2.33 & -1 & 2 \\
   2.67 & 1 & -2 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   14.345 & 5.345 & -6 \\
   5.345 & 3 & -4 \\
   -6 & -4 & 8
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

   \[
   = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   7.1725 & 2.6725 & -3 \\
   2.6725 & 1.5 & -2 \\
   -3 & -2 & 4
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

### 5. Data Normalization, Standardization, and Encoding

### (a) Normalization vs. Standardization:

- **Normalization:**
  - **Definition:** Scaling the data to fit within a specific range, typically [0, 1].
  - **Formula:** \(X' = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}\)
  - **Use Case:** Useful when the features have different scales and you want to bring them to a common scale.

- **Standardization:**
  - **Definition:** Scaling the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  - **Formula:** \(X' = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\)
  - **Use Case:** Useful when the features are normally distributed and you want to standardize the data.

### (b) One Hot Encoding vs. Label Encoding:

- **One Hot Encoding:**
  - **Definition:** Converts categorical variables into a binary matrix representation.
  - **How it works:** Creates a new binary column for each category.
  - **Use Case:** Preferred when the categorical variable does not have

 an ordinal relationship.

  **Example:**
  - **Categories:** Red, Green, Blue
  - **One Hot Encoded:** [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]

- **Label Encoding:**
  - **Definition:** Converts categorical variables into integer codes.
  - **How it works:** Assigns an integer value to each category.
  - **Use Case:** Preferred when the categorical variable has an ordinal relationship.

  **Example:**
  - **Categories:** Red, Green, Blue
  - **Label Encoded:** 0, 1, 2
