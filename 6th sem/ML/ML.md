## What are Classic Machines?

Classic machines, sometimes referred to as classical machine learning algorithms are a subset of [machine learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/) algorithms that discover patterns and relationships in data using statistical techniques. These algorithms are made to perform well in situations with a defined scope and a distinct set of characteristics.

Classic machines examine data inputs according to a predetermined set of rules, finding patterns and relationships that can be used to generate predictions or choices. Support vector machines, decision trees, and logistic regression are some of the most used classical machine-learning techniques.

### Advantages of classic machines

- **Natural language processing:** 
- **Data mining:** 
- **Fraud detection:** 
- **Medical diagnosis:**

## What are Adaptive machines?

A class of [machine learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/) techniques called adaptive machines, commonly referred to as adaptive or [deep learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-deep-learning/), is created to automatically learn from data inputs without being explicitly programmed. By learning hierarchical representations of the input, these algorithms are able to handle more complex and unstructured data, such as photos, videos, and natural language.

Artificial neural networks, which are designed after the composition and operation of the human brain, are used by adaptive machines. These neural networks are made up of layers of connected nodes, or neurons, where each one carries out a straightforward calculation. The neurons are arranged in layers, and each layer processes the input data in a unique way.

### Advantages of Adaptive machines

Some advantages of adaptive machines include:

- **Handling complicated and unstructured data:** 
- **Better accuracy:** 
- **Automatic feature learning:**
- **Scalability:** 
### Disadvantages of Adaptive machines

- Large volumes of labeled data are necessary for adaptive machine learning algorithms to train efficiently. Usually, more data is needed the more complicated the situation is. Data collection and labeling can take a lot of time and money.
- A large amount of computing power is needed for adaptive machine learning methods, including strong hardware and specialized software frameworks. It can take days or weeks to train deep neural networks, and this demands a lot of memory and computing power.
- Overfitting is a problem that can affect adaptive machine-learning algorithms. It happens when the model gets too complicated and begins to memorize the training data rather than learning broader patterns. Poor performance on new data can result from overfitting.
- Adaptive machine learning algorithms are susceptible to adversarial attacks, in which rogue actors deliberately alter the input data to make the model produce inaccurate predictions or judgments.

### Application of Adaptive machines

- **Recognition of voice and images:** 
- **Language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots**
- **Systems for making recommendations**: 
- **Autonomous vehicles:**
