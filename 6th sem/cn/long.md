### 1. TCP/IP Reference Model and Transmission Media

**a) TCP/IP Reference Model Layers:**
1. **Application Layer:** This layer includes protocols and services that directly support user applications, such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS. It handles application-specific data and provides interfaces for communication services to the end-users.
2. **Transport Layer:** This layer provides end-to-end communication services for applications. It includes protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP offers reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and flow control, while UDP provides a faster, connectionless service without error checking.
3. **Internet Layer:** This layer is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. The primary protocol at this layer is the IP (Internet Protocol), which handles addressing and routing packets across networks.
4. **Network Access Layer:** This layer covers protocols for data link and physical layers of the network architecture. It includes the hardware and software necessary to connect to a physical network, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

**b) Types of Transmission Media:**
1. **Twisted Pair Cable:**
   - **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):** Commonly used in Ethernet networks. It consists of pairs of wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference.
   - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):** Similar to UTP but with a shielding that provides additional protection against interference.
   - **Pros:** Inexpensive, easy to install, widely used.
   - **Cons:** Limited bandwidth, susceptible to electromagnetic interference.

**c) Star Topology and Bus Topology:**
- **Star Topology:**
  - All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data passes through the central device to reach other devices.
  - **Pros:** Easy to install and manage, robust (failure of one device does not affect others).
  - **Cons:** If the central hub/switch fails, the entire network goes down.

- **Bus Topology:**
  - All devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus. Data sent by any device is available to all other devices.
  - **Pros:** Easy to install, requires less cable.
  - **Cons:** Difficult to troubleshoot, a failure in the bus cable can disable the entire network, prone to collisions.

### 3. Fiber Optic Cable and Network Architecture

### 5. Error Correction and Switching Techniques

**a) Proof for Redundancy Bits:**
- **Statement:** \(2^r \geq m + r + 1\)
  - **Where:**
    - \(m\) = number of data bits
    - \(r\) = number of redundancy bits

- **Proof:** For a Hamming code to correct a single-bit error, the number of redundancy bits \(r\) must be sufficient to create \(2^r\) unique combinations, covering all data bits and redundancy bits:
  \[
  2^r \geq m + r + 1
  \]
  - Each combination can uniquely identify a bit position including an error bit and a no-error state.

**b) Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching:**
- **Circuit Switching:**
  - **Advantages:** Dedicated path provides consistent and reliable communication with guaranteed bandwidth.
  - **Disadvantages:** Inefficient use of resources (path remains reserved even when not in use), longer setup time.

- **Packet Switching:**
  - **Advantages:** Efficient use of network resources, flexible, suitable for bursty data traffic.
  - **Disadvantages:** Potential for packet loss and delays, requires complex routing and reassembly.

### Question 6

#### a) Mention the significance of “Time to Live” field in IPv4 datagram header.

1. **Preventing Infinite Loops**:
   - **Significance**: The Time to Live (TTL) field is crucial in preventing packets from circulating indefinitely in the network. This is particularly important in cases where routing loops exist due to misconfigurations or dynamic routing changes.
   - **Mechanism**: Each router that forwards the packet decrements the TTL value by one. When the TTL value reaches zero, the packet is discarded, ensuring that it doesn't loop forever.

2. **Network Traffic Management**:
   - **Significance**: By limiting the lifespan of packets, the TTL field helps manage and control network congestion. This helps to avoid unnecessary load on the network caused by undeliverable packets.
   - **Mechanism**: Routers and other networking devices use the TTL value to make forwarding decisions that can prioritize the handling of packets more efficiently.

3. **Troubleshooting and Diagnostics**:
   - **Significance**: The TTL field is also used in diagnostic tools like `traceroute`, which help network administrators understand the path packets take through the network and identify where delays or failures occur.
   - **Mechanism**: By sending packets with incrementally increasing TTL values, `traceroute` identifies each hop along the path to the destination by the ICMP "Time Exceeded" messages returned by intermediate routers.

#### b) Calculate the remainder using CRC technique obtained at the sender side by dividing a given polynomial \((x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)\) with generator polynomial \((x^4 + x + 1)\).

To calculate the remainder, we perform binary division. The given polynomials can be represented in binary form:

- **Data polynomial (dividend)**: \(x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 \rightarrow 1101101111\)
- **Generator polynomial (divisor)**: \(x^4 + x + 1 \rightarrow 10011\)

1. **Append zeros**: Append 4 zeros (degree of the generator polynomial) to the data polynomial: `11011011110000`.

2. **Perform binary division**:
   ```
   11011011110000 (dividend)
   10011           (divisor)
   ----------------
   01001011110000
   00000010011
   ----------------
   010000011000
   0000010011
   ----------------
   01000011000
   00000010011
   ----------------
   0100010100
   0000010011
   ----------------
   010001110
   0000010011
   ----------------
   010010011
   0000010011
   ----------------
   0000010000
   00000010011
   ----------------
   0000000111
   ```

The final remainder is `0111`.

#### c) An Ethernet MAC sub-layer receives 1510 bytes of data from the upper layer. Can the data be encapsulated in one frame? If not, how many frames are needed? Calculate the size of data in each frame.

Ethernet frames have a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes for the data payload.

- **Data from upper layer**: 1510 bytes.
- **Maximum payload size per frame**: 1500 bytes.

Since 1510 bytes of data exceed the MTU of a single Ethernet frame, the data must be split into two frames.

1. **First frame**: 1500 bytes of data.
2. **Second frame**: \(1510 - 1500 = 10\) bytes of data.

So, two frames are needed:
- **Frame 1**: 1500 bytes
- **Frame 2**: 10 bytes

### Summary

- **Time to Live (TTL) field**: Prevents infinite loops, manages network traffic, and aids in troubleshooting.
- **CRC remainder**: The remainder obtained is `0111`.
- **Ethernet framing**: Two frames are needed, with the first frame carrying 1500 bytes and the second frame carrying 10 bytes.
### Question 7

#### a) A 10-bit data bit block 0111010111 is to be sent using Hamming code for error detection and correction. Show how the receiver corrects an error that occurs in the 6th bit position from the right.

1. **Identify positions for parity bits**: In a 10-bit data, we need to place parity bits. The total length will be 10 data bits + parity bits. For Hamming code, the number of parity bits `r` can be found such that \(2^r \geq m + r + 1\), where `m` is the number of data bits.

   - For 10 data bits, we need at least 4 parity bits since \(2^4 = 16 \geq 10 + 4 + 1\).

2. **Position the parity bits in the data**: Parity bits are placed at positions which are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8,...).

   Initial bit sequence: `0111010111`
   Adding parity bits: `_ _ 0 _ 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1`
   
   Here, `_` denotes positions for parity bits.

3. **Calculate parity bits**:
   - \(P1\) covers bits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11: \(_ _ 0 _ 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\)
     - \(P1 = 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   - \(P2\) covers bits 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11: \(_ _ 0 _ 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\)
     - \(P2 = 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   - \(P4\) covers bits 4, 5, 6, 7, 12: \(_ _ 0 _ 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\)
     - \(P4 = 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   - \(P8\) covers bits 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: \(_ _ 0 _ 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\)
     - \(P8 = 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1\)

   The complete Hamming code: `11101101111`

4. **Receiver side correction**:
   - Suppose an error occurs at the 6th bit from the right. The received sequence is: `11101111111`.
   - Check parity bits:
     - \(P1\) covers bits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11: \(P1 = 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1 \neq 0\)
     - \(P2\) covers bits 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11: \(P2 = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \neq 1\)
     - \(P4\) covers bits 4, 5, 6, 7, 12: \(P4 = 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1 \neq 0\)
     - \(P8\) covers bits 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: \(P8 = 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1 \neq 0\)

   The binary sum of error positions (1+2+4) gives the bit position with error, which is 6. Correct the error by flipping the bit at position 6:

   Original sequence: `11101111111`
   Corrected sequence: `11101101111`
   Data bits: `0111010111`

#### b) 

**a) Distinguish between peer-to-peer relationship and a primary-secondary relationship.**

- **Peer-to-peer relationship**:
  - **Description**: In a peer-to-peer network, each node (peer) can act both as a client and a server.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - All nodes have equal status.
    - Nodes share resources directly with each other.
    - Common in small networks or for file-sharing applications.

- **Primary-secondary relationship**:
  - **Description**: In a primary-secondary relationship, one node (primary) controls the communication and operations of other nodes (secondary).
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Centralized control by the primary node.
    - Secondary nodes depend on the primary for tasks and communication.
    - Common in master-slave configurations and some network management scenarios.

**b) Define checksum.**

- **Checksum**:
  - **Description**: A checksum is an error-detection method used to ensure the integrity of data transmitted over a network or stored in a medium.
  - **Calculation**: It is computed by summing the binary values of data segments and appending the sum (or its complement) to the data. Upon receiving, the checksum is recalculated and compared to the transmitted checksum.
  - **Use**: Widely used in networking protocols, file transfer protocols, and data storage to detect errors.

### Question 8

#### a) The code 11110101101 was received. Using the Hamming code method find out what was the original code sent.

1. **Position and identify parity bits**:
   - Hamming code positions parity bits at positions that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8,...).

   Received code: `11110101101`

2. **Check parity bits**:
   - \(P1\) (1st bit) checks bits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11: \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 = 1\)
   - \(P2\) (2nd bit) checks bits 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11: \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   - \(P4\) (4th bit) checks bits 4, 5, 6, 7: \(1 \oplus 0 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   - \(P8\) (8th bit) checks bits 8, 9, 10, 11: \(0 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 = 0\)

   The error position is identified by combining these results: \(1_2 = 1\), \(0_2 = 0\), \(0_4 = 0\), \(0_8 = 0\). Hence, the position is `1`.

   Error in bit position 1. Correcting it: `01110101101` becomes `11110101101`.

3. **Original code**: Corrected data bits: `0110101101`

#### b) 

**Distinguish between a router and a bridge. What do you mean by transparent bridge?**

- **Router**:
  - **Function**: Connects different networks and routes data packets between them based on IP addresses.
  - **Layer**: Operates at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
  - **Features**: Can perform traffic directing functions, supports multiple protocols, and provides NAT, firewall, and VPN functionalities.

- **Bridge**:
  - **Function**: Connects two or more LAN segments, making them function as a single network.
  - **Layer**: Operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
  - **Features**: Filters traffic based on MAC addresses, reduces collisions by dividing collision domains.

- **Transparent Bridge**:
  - **Definition**: A type of bridge that learns MAC addresses automatically and forwards frames based on the learned addresses without requiring any configuration.
  - **Operation**: The bridge is "transparent" to the connected devices, meaning they are unaware of its existence and operation.

#### c) What is Redundancy?

- **Redundancy**:
  - **Definition**: Redundancy refers to the inclusion of extra components, data, or resources that are not strictly necessary for functionality but serve to provide a backup in case of failure.
  - **Types**:
    - **Data Redundancy**: Duplication of data for error checking and correction.
    - **Hardware Redundancy**: Extra hardware components that take over in case of failure.
    - **Network Redundancy**: Multiple pathways and devices to ensure network reliability and availability.
  - **Purpose**: Enhances system reliability, fault tolerance, and ensures continuity of operations in case of failures or errors.
### Question 9

#### a) Discuss and differentiate between persistent CSMA and non-persistent CSMA.

**Persistent CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access):**

- **Operation:**
  1. **Sense Carrier**: Before transmitting, a node continuously senses the carrier (channel).
  2. **Busy Channel**: If the channel is busy, the node waits until the channel becomes idle.
  3. **Idle Channel**: Once the channel is idle, the node immediately transmits its data.
  4. **Collision Detection**: If a collision occurs, the node waits for a random backoff time before reattempting transmission.

- **Advantages:**
  - Higher utilization of the channel as the node transmits immediately when the channel is free.
  - Reduced idle time since nodes do not wait unnecessarily.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Higher probability of collisions, especially in networks with heavy traffic.
  - Increased collisions can lead to inefficiency and congestion.

**Non-persistent CSMA:**

- **Operation:**
  1. **Sense Carrier**: Before transmitting, a node senses the carrier (channel).
  2. **Busy Channel**: If the channel is busy, the node waits for a random amount of time before sensing the channel again.
  3. **Idle Channel**: If the channel is idle when sensed, the node transmits its data.
  4. **Collision Detection**: If a collision occurs, the node waits for another random backoff time before reattempting transmission.

- **Advantages:**
  - Lower probability of collisions as nodes do not continuously sense the channel and attempt to transmit immediately.
  - Reduced chances of congestion compared to persistent CSMA.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Lower utilization of the channel due to random waiting periods even when the channel is free.
  - Increased idle time can lead to inefficiency, especially under light traffic conditions.

#### b) Suppose a system uses Go-back-N protocol with window size 3. If a sender wants to transmit 6 frames and every 4th frame is error, then calculate how many number of extra frames to be transmitted to the receiver.

- **Initial Transmission:**
  - Frames: 0, 1, 2 (all acknowledged)
  - Frames: 3, 4, 5 (error in frame 3)

- **After error detection (4th frame is error):**
  - Sender detects error in frame 3 after transmitting frames 3, 4, and 5.
  - Go-back-N requires retransmitting frame 3 and subsequent frames.

- **Retransmission:**
  - Frames: 3, 4, 5 (successfully received and acknowledged)

- **Total frames transmitted:**
  - Initial: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (6 frames)
  - Retransmission: 3, 4, 5 (3 frames)

  **Total extra frames: 3**

### Question 10

#### a) Why is CSMA/CD not implemented in WLAN?

- **Reason 1: Collision Detection**: WLANs operate using radio waves, which do not allow for collision detection during transmission. Unlike wired networks, where a node can detect collisions by monitoring signal strength on the cable, wireless nodes cannot detect collisions while transmitting.

- **Reason 2: Hidden Node Problem**: In WLANs, not all nodes can hear each other due to the limited range of wireless signals. This causes the hidden node problem where two nodes out of each other's range transmit simultaneously, leading to collisions.

- **Reason 3: Full-Duplex Communication**: WLANs typically use half-duplex communication where nodes cannot send and receive data simultaneously. Implementing CSMA/CD, which requires full-duplex capabilities to detect collisions, is impractical in such an environment.

#### b) Describe 802.3 frame formats. Why is padding required?

**802.3 Frame Format:**

1. **Preamble (7 bytes)**: A sequence of 56 bits used to synchronize the receiver’s clock.
2. **Start Frame Delimiter (1 byte)**: Indicates the start of the frame, providing a boundary.
3. **Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)**: Specifies the MAC address of the receiving device.
4. **Source MAC Address (6 bytes)**: Specifies the MAC address of the sending device.
5. **Length/Type (2 bytes)**: Indicates the type of payload or the length of the data.
6. **Data and Padding (46-1500 bytes)**: Contains the actual data and, if necessary, padding to meet the minimum length requirement.
7. **Frame Check Sequence (4 bytes)**: Contains a CRC value used for error checking.

**Padding:**

- **Purpose**: Ensures the frame meets the minimum length requirement of 64 bytes for Ethernet frames. If the data portion is less than 46 bytes, padding bytes are added to reach this minimum length.
- **Reason**: Helps in collision detection by ensuring that frames are long enough to be detected during transmission, enhancing network reliability and error detection.

#### c) Why is acknowledgment numbered in stop-and-wait protocol? Discuss the situation when unnumbered acknowledgments can create confusion at the sender and receiver end.

**Acknowledgment Numbering in Stop-and-Wait Protocol:**

- **Purpose**: Ensures reliable data transmission by confirming the receipt of each data frame. The numbering helps in distinguishing between new data frames and retransmissions, preventing duplication.
  
**Situation with Unnumbered Acknowledgments:**

- **Issue**: Without numbered acknowledgments, the sender cannot distinguish between acknowledgments for different frames or repeated acknowledgments due to lost acknowledgments or retransmissions.
  
- **Example**:
  1. **Frame Lost**: Sender sends frame 1, which is lost. Receiver sends acknowledgment for frame 0 (last correctly received frame).
  2. **Confusion**: Sender, upon receiving the acknowledgment for frame 0, might wrongly assume that frame 1 was received and sends frame 2.
  3. **Receiver State**: Receiver is expecting frame 1 but receives frame 2, leading to confusion and possible data loss or duplication.

Numbered acknowledgments prevent such confusion by explicitly indicating the frame being acknowledged, ensuring synchronization between sender and receiver.

### Question 11

#### a) Differentiate between ARP and RARP.

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**

- **Purpose**: Maps a known IP address to a MAC address.
- **Usage**: Used when a device needs to communicate with another device on the same local network but only knows its IP address.
- **Process**: Broadcasts an ARP request on the network, and the device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address.

**RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):**

- **Purpose**: Maps a known MAC address to an IP address.
- **Usage**: Used by diskless workstations or devices that know their MAC address but need to obtain an IP address from a server.
- **Process**: Sends a RARP request to a RARP server, which replies with the corresponding IP address.

#### b) State the advantage of IPv6 over IPv4.

- **Larger Address Space**: IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing a significantly larger address space compared to IPv4's 32-bit addresses, accommodating more devices.
- **Improved Security**: IPv6 includes IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) support as a fundamental feature, enhancing network security.
- **Better Performance**: IPv6 simplifies packet processing with a streamlined header format, reducing the overhead and improving performance.
- **Auto-configuration**: IPv6 supports stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC), allowing devices to configure themselves automatically without the need for a DHCP server.
- **No NAT Required**: The vast address space eliminates the need for Network Address Translation (NAT), simplifying network management and enabling true end-to-end connectivity.

### Question 12

#### a) What do you mean by unicasting, multicasting, and broadcasting?

**Unicasting:**
- **Definition:** Unicasting refers to the transmission of data from one sender to one specific receiver.
- **Example:** Sending an email from one computer to another computer's unique IP address.

**Multicasting:**
- **Definition:** Multicasting involves transmitting data from one sender to multiple specific receivers who have expressed interest in receiving the data.
- **Example:** Streaming a live video to multiple users who have subscribed to the multicast group.

**Broadcasting:**
- **Definition:** Broadcasting is the transmission of data from one sender to all possible receivers in the network.
- **Example:** Broadcasting a message or an alert to all devices on a local network.

#### b) Explain link state routing.

**Link State Routing:**
- **Definition:** Link state routing is a routing algorithm used in computer networks to determine the shortest path between nodes. Each node maintains a map of the network topology, indicating the state of its directly connected links.
- **Process:**
  1. **Link State Advertisement (LSA):** Each node periodically sends out LSA packets containing information about its directly connected links.
  2. **Link State Database (LSDB):** Nodes collect LSAs from all other nodes in the network to build a complete LSDB, representing the network topology.
  3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Nodes use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to calculate the shortest path from themselves to all other nodes in the network based on the LSDB.
  4. **Routing Table:** Based on the results of Dijkstra's algorithm, each node constructs its routing table, which contains the next hop for each destination node.

#### c) Find the class of the following IP addresses:

i) 11110111  11110011  10000111  11011101

- **Class:** This IP address falls into Class D.
- **Explanation:** Class D IP addresses are reserved for multicast addresses, used for multicast group communication.

ii) 01111111  11110000  01100111  01111101

- **Class:** This IP address falls into Class A.
- **Explanation:** Class A IP addresses have the first bit set to 0, indicating that the address range is from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255. This range is used for very large networks with a large number of hosts.

### Question 13

#### a) A channel has a data rate 4 kbps and propagation delay of 20 ms. For what range of frame size does stop-and-wait give an efficiency of at least 50%?

**Efficiency of Stop-and-Wait Protocol:**
- **Formula:** Efficiency = (Frame Size) / (Frame Size + 2 * Propagation Delay)
- **Given:**
  - Data Rate = 4 kbps
  - Propagation Delay = 20 ms
- **Efficiency ≥ 50%:**
  - 50% = (Frame Size) / (Frame Size + 2 * 20 ms)
  - Solving for Frame Size: Frame Size ≥ 40 ms / (1 / 2000) = 80 bits
  - Therefore, the frame size should be at least 80 bits for an efficiency of at least 50%.

#### b) What are Bit rate and Baud rate? An analog signal carries 4 bits in each signal unit. If 1000 signal units are sent per second, find the Baud rate and Bit rate.

**Bit Rate:**
- **Definition:** Bit rate is the number of bits transmitted per unit of time, usually measured in bits per second (bps).
- **Calculation:** Given that each signal unit carries 4 bits and 1000 signal units are sent per second, the Bit Rate = 4 bits/signal unit * 1000 signal units/s = 4000 bps.

**Baud Rate:**
- **Definition:** Baud rate is the number of signal units per second, representing the rate of change of the signal per second. It is also measured in baud.
- **Calculation:** Given that 1000 signal units are sent per second, the Baud Rate = 1000 baud.
### Question 14

#### a) Differentiate between connection-oriented and connectionless services implemented by the network layer.

**Connection-Oriented:**
- **Definition:** Connection-oriented services establish a logical connection between the sender and receiver before data transfer begins. This connection involves a setup phase, data transfer phase, and teardown phase.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Reliable data delivery through mechanisms like acknowledgment and retransmission.
  - Sequencing of data packets to ensure they arrive in the correct order.
  - Flow control to manage the rate of data transmission.
- **Example:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol used in the transport layer.

**Connectionless:**
- **Definition:** Connectionless services do not establish a dedicated connection before transmitting data. Each data packet is treated independently and routed separately based on its destination address.
- **Characteristics:**
  - No setup phase is required before data transmission.
  - Lack of reliability guarantees, as there is no acknowledgment or retransmission mechanism.
  - No sequencing of data packets, so they may arrive out of order.
- **Example:** UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol used in the transport layer.

#### b) Differentiate between pure ALOHA and slotted ALOHA.

**Pure ALOHA:**
- **Transmission Method:** Stations transmit data frames whenever they have data to send, without regard for the timing of other stations.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Simple, but inefficient due to collisions.
  - Frames can collide and may need to be retransmitted, leading to lower efficiency.
- **Example:** Pure ALOHA was an early Ethernet protocol.

**Slotted ALOHA:**
- **Transmission Method:** Time is divided into discrete slots, and stations are synchronized to these slots. Stations can only transmit at the beginning of a time slot.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Reduces the likelihood of collisions compared to pure ALOHA.
  - Higher efficiency than pure ALOHA due to reduced collision probability.
- **Example:** Slotted ALOHA is an improvement over pure ALOHA used in some wireless communication systems.

#### c) Discuss the various persistence strategies provided by CSMA.

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA):**
- **Definition:** CSMA is a protocol used in network communication to avoid collisions between data frames transmitted simultaneously by multiple stations.
- **Persistence Strategies:**
  1. **1-Persistent CSMA:** A station continuously monitors the channel and waits for it to become idle. Once idle, it transmits its frame. If the channel is busy, the station continues to wait until it becomes idle.
  2. **p-Persistent CSMA:** A station with data to transmit waits for the channel to become idle. When idle, it transmits with a probability 'p'. If the channel is busy, it waits for the next slot and repeats the process.
  3. **Non-Persistent CSMA:** A station waits for the channel to become idle. Once idle, it waits for a random period of time before attempting to transmit. If the channel is busy when the random time elapses, it repeats the process.

These persistence strategies vary in their efficiency and ability to handle collisions and are used in different network scenarios based on their requirements.
### Question 15

#### a) What is the connection-oriented protocol? Briefly explain the services of that protocol.

**Connection-Oriented Protocol:**
- A connection-oriented protocol is a communication protocol that establishes a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver before data transfer begins.
- **Services Provided:**
  1. **Connection Establishment:** The protocol initiates a handshake process to establish a logical connection between the sender and receiver.
  2. **Reliable Data Transfer:** Ensures reliable delivery of data by using acknowledgment mechanisms, retransmission of lost packets, and sequencing of packets to ensure they are delivered in order.
  3. **Flow Control:** Regulates the flow of data to prevent overwhelming the receiver with too much data too quickly.
  4. **Error Detection and Correction:** Implements error detection and correction techniques to ensure the integrity of data during transmission.

#### b) Briefly discuss the token management using priority in IEEE 802.5.

**Token Management with Priority in IEEE 802.5:**
- IEEE 802.5 is a standard for token ring networks, where nodes communicate by passing a token from one node to another.
- **Token Management with Priority:**
  - In IEEE 802.5, each node is assigned a priority level, determining its access to the token.
  - When a node wishes to transmit data, it waits for the token to arrive and then sends the data along with the token.
  - Nodes with higher priority levels have the right to capture the token more frequently than nodes with lower priority levels.
  - This ensures that nodes with higher priority can transmit their data more frequently, thus providing better service for high-priority traffic.

### Question 16

#### a) Discuss in detail about the connection establishment procedure performed by LCP with the help of various LCP packets.

**Connection Establishment Procedure by LCP (Link Control Protocol):**
1. **Link Establishment Phase:**
   - **LCP Configuration:** Initiating device sends a Configure-Request packet to the remote device, proposing a set of configuration parameters.
   - **Configuration Acknowledgment:** Remote device responds with a Configure-Ack packet if it accepts the proposed parameters or Configure-Reject if it rejects them.
   - **Negotiation:** Both devices negotiate the configuration parameters until an agreement is reached.
2. **Link Termination Phase:**
   - **LCP Termination Request:** Initiating device sends a Terminate-Request packet to terminate the link.
   - **Termination Acknowledgment:** Remote device responds with a Terminate-Ack packet to acknowledge the termination request.
3. **Link Authentication Phase (Optional):**
   - **Authentication Request:** Initiating device sends an Authentication-Request packet to authenticate the link.
   - **Authentication Response:** Remote device responds with an Authentication-Ack packet if authentication is successful or Authentication-Nak if it fails.

#### b) Explain in detail the state transition diagram of PPP.

**State Transition Diagram of PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):**
- PPP has several states in its state transition diagram, including:
  1. **Initial State (Down):** The link is initially in this state, waiting for the link to be established.
  2. **Link Establishment Phase:** Transitions to this state when the link establishment process begins.
  3. **Link Termination Phase:** Enters this state when the link termination process starts.
  4. **Network-Layer Protocol Phase:** The link is in this state when data transmission is active.
- **State Transition:**
  - **Upward Transitions:** Represent the establishment and activation of the link.
  - **Downward Transitions:** Represent the termination and deactivation of the link.
- **Transitions Triggered By:**
  - **Link Configuration:** Successful negotiation of link configuration parameters.
  - **Link Termination:** Request to terminate the link from either end.
  - **Authentication:** Successful or failed authentication attempts.
- **Transitional Actions:** These are actions taken during state transitions, such as sending control packets, changing link parameters, or terminating the link.

#### c) Discuss the mechanism for authentication provided by Challenge Handshake Protocol.

**Authentication Mechanism in Challenge Handshake Protocol (CHAP):**
1. **Initialization:**
   - **CHAP Challenge:** The authenticator (server) sends a random challenge string to the peer (client).
   - **Response Calculation:** The client uses a one-way hash function (like MD5) to hash the challenge concatenated with a secret key known only to the client.
   - **CHAP Response:** The client sends the hashed response back to the server.
2. **Verification:**
   - **Authentication Check:** The server receives the response and performs the same calculation using its copy of the client's secret key.
   - **Comparison:** The server compares the calculated response with the received response.
   - **Authentication Result:** If the two responses match, the authentication is successful, and the connection is established. Otherwise, it fails.
3. **Periodic Reauthentication:**
   - **Challenge Renewal:** To ensure security, the server periodically sends new challenges to the client, requiring it to reauthenticate using the same process.
   - **Security Enhancement:** This prevents replay attacks by ensuring that the client cannot reuse a previously obtained response.
### Question 17

#### a) An ISP has a block of 1024 addresses. It needs to divide the address among 1024 customers. Does it need subnetting? Justify.

**Answer:**
Yes, subnetting is needed in this scenario. Subnetting allows the division of a single network into multiple smaller subnetworks, each with its own network address and range of host addresses. 

**Justification:**
1. **Address Utilization:** Without subnetting, the ISP would have a single network with 1024 addresses, which might be inefficient for allocating to individual customers. Subnetting allows for more efficient utilization of the address space.
2. **Network Segmentation:** Subnetting provides logical segmentation of the network, allowing the ISP to manage and organize its network infrastructure more effectively.
3. **Security and Control:** Subnetting enables the ISP to implement security measures and access controls at the subnet level, enhancing network security and control.

#### b) A class B network on the internet has a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0. What is the maximum number of hosts per subnet?

**Answer:**
To determine the maximum number of hosts per subnet, we need to calculate the number of host addresses available within the subnet.

**Calculation:**
- Given subnet mask: 255.255.240.0
- This corresponds to a /20 subnet mask in CIDR notation (32 - 20 = 12 bits for host addresses).
- The formula to calculate the number of host addresses is 2^(number of host bits) - 2.
- For a /20 subnet, there are 12 host bits, so the calculation is: 2^12 - 2 = 4096 - 2 = 4094.

**Maximum Number of Hosts per Subnet:** 4094 hosts.

#### c) What are the HTTP and the HTTPS protocol?

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
- HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. 
- It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.
- It operates over TCP/IP and typically uses port 80 for communication.
- It is a stateless protocol, meaning each command is executed independently without any knowledge of the previous commands.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**
- HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, where the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
- It ensures that sensitive data exchanged between a web server and a browser remains confidential and secure from eavesdroppers.
- HTTPS operates over TCP/IP, similar to HTTP, but uses port 443 for communication.
- It provides authentication of the website and protects the integrity and privacy of the exchanged data, such as login credentials, financial transactions, and personal information.

**Key Differences:**
- HTTPS adds a layer of security through encryption, while HTTP operates without encryption.
- HTTPS uses port 443 by default, whereas HTTP uses port 80.
- HTTPS provides authentication and data integrity, making it suitable for secure transactions and communications, while HTTP does not provide these features.
### Question 18

#### a) What is CIDR notation? What is its significance in the case of classless addressing?

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation:**
- CIDR notation is a method used to represent IP addresses and their associated network prefixes. 
- It specifies the network prefix followed by a forward slash ("/") and the number of significant bits in the network prefix. 
- For example, the CIDR notation for the IP address 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 would be 192.168.1.0/24, where "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits represent the network address.

**Significance in Classless Addressing:**
- In classless addressing, IP addresses are allocated based on variable-length prefixes, unlike classful addressing where addresses are assigned based on fixed-length classes (Class A, B, or C).
- CIDR notation provides a flexible way to represent and allocate IP address blocks with different subnet sizes, allowing for efficient utilization of address space and aggregation of routing information.
- It facilitates route summarization, reducing the size of routing tables and improving the efficiency of routing in large-scale networks, such as the internet.

#### b) What do you mean by subnet masking? Explain how it can be achieved with an example.

**Subnet Masking:**
- Subnet masking is the process of dividing an IP network into subnetworks, called subnets, by borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address and using them to create additional network addresses.
- It involves the use of a subnet mask, which is a 32-bit number that consists of consecutive "1" bits followed by consecutive "0" bits. The "1" bits represent the network portion, and the "0" bits represent the host portion of the address.

**Example:**
- Consider the IP address 192.168.1.0 with the default subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation).
- To create subnets, we can borrow additional bits from the host portion of the address. Let's say we borrow 3 bits, which allows us to create 8 (2^3) subnets.
- The subnet mask for the new subnets would be 255.255.255.224 (or /27 in CIDR notation), where the first 27 bits represent the network portion, and the remaining bits are used for host addresses.
- Each subnet created using subnet masking will have its own range of valid host addresses, allowing for efficient organization and management of network resources.

### Question 19

#### a) Differentiate between pure ALOHA and slotted ALOHA.

**Pure ALOHA:**
- In pure ALOHA, stations transmit data packets whenever they have data to send, without any coordination with other stations.
- The transmission occurs randomly, and collisions may occur if two or more stations transmit at the same time, resulting in data loss.
- After a collision, stations wait for a random amount of time before attempting to retransmit the packet.

**Slotted ALOHA:**
- Slotted ALOHA divides time into discrete slots, with each slot corresponding to the time it takes to transmit one data packet.
- Stations are required to wait for the beginning of the next time slot before transmitting their data packets.
- This synchronized approach reduces the probability of collisions compared to pure ALOHA, as it ensures that all stations start transmitting at the beginning of a time slot.
- Collisions can still occur if two or more stations attempt to transmit in the same time slot.

#### b) What are the basic functions of an email system?

**Basic Functions of an Email System:**
1. **Sending and Receiving Messages:** The primary function of an email system is to send and receive electronic messages between users.
2. **Addressing:** Users can specify the recipient(s) of the message using email addresses.
3. **Storage and Retrieval:** Email systems provide storage for both incoming and outgoing messages, allowing users to access and retrieve their messages at any time.
4. **Attachments:** Users can attach files, documents, or multimedia content to their email messages for sharing with recipients.
5. **Folder Organization:** Email systems often include features for organizing messages into folders or labels, helping users manage their emails more effectively.
6. **Search and Filtering:** Email clients typically offer search functionality to help users find specific messages, as well as filtering options to sort incoming messages based on criteria such as sender, subject, or keywords.
7. **Security and Privacy:** Email systems implement security measures such as encryption and authentication to protect the privacy and integrity of messages during transmission and storage.
8. **Notifications:** Users may receive notifications or alerts when new messages arrive in their inbox, ensuring timely communication.

#### c) What are the methods to improve Quality of Service (QoS)?

**Methods to Improve QoS:**
1. **Traffic Prioritization:** Prioritize critical traffic types, such as voice or video, over less time-sensitive data to ensure their timely delivery.
2. **Bandwidth Management:** Allocate sufficient bandwidth to different types of traffic based on their requirements, preventing congestion and ensuring smooth transmission.
3. **Quality of Experience (QoE) Monitoring:** Continuously monitor network performance and user experience to identify and address potential bottlenecks or issues affecting QoS.
4. **Traffic Shaping and Policing:** Shape network traffic to smooth out bursts and regulate the flow of data, while policing ensures compliance with defined traffic policies and limits.
5. **Resource Reservation:** Reserve network resources, such as bandwidth or buffer space, for specific applications or services to guarantee their performance levels.
6. **Congestion Control:** Implement congestion control mechanisms, such as Random Early Detection (RED) or Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), to manage congestion and prevent network degradation.
7. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Establish SLAs with service providers or customers, defining agreed-upon performance metrics and guarantees to ensure QoS expectations are met.
8. **Redundancy and Failover:** Deploy redundant network components and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and maintain service availability during failures or outages.
9. **Packet Classification and Queuing:** Classify packets based on their priority or type and use appropriate queuing techniques, such as Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) or Priority Queuing (PQ), to manage traffic and optimize QoS.
### Question 20

#### a) What is congestion? Why does congestion occur?

**Congestion:**
- Congestion refers to a situation in a network where the traffic demand exceeds the available network capacity, leading to degraded performance, increased latency, packet loss, and potential service disruption.

**Causes of Congestion:**
1. **Network Overload:** When the volume of data traffic surpasses the capacity of network links or devices, congestion occurs.
2. **Limited Resources:** Insufficient network resources, such as bandwidth, buffer space, or processing capacity, can lead to congestion.
3. **Bursty Traffic:** Sporadic bursts of traffic, especially during peak hours or sudden spikes in demand, can overwhelm network resources.
4. **Misconfiguration or Faults:** Improper configuration of network devices, routing loops, or hardware failures can contribute to congestion.
5. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** Malicious attempts to flood a network with excessive traffic can cause congestion and disrupt normal operations.

#### b) Write a short note on Congestion Avoidance techniques in detail.

**Congestion Avoidance Techniques:**
1. **Traffic Shaping:** Traffic shaping regulates the flow of data by buffering and scheduling packets to match the network capacity, preventing bursts of traffic that could lead to congestion.
2. **Quality of Service (QoS):** QoS mechanisms prioritize critical traffic types, such as voice or video, over less time-sensitive data to ensure their timely delivery and minimize the impact of congestion.
3. **Capacity Planning:** Proper capacity planning involves forecasting traffic growth, upgrading network infrastructure, and optimizing resource allocation to accommodate increasing demand and mitigate congestion.
4. **Congestion Control Algorithms:** Various congestion control algorithms, such as TCP congestion control mechanisms like TCP Reno or TCP Vegas, dynamically adjust transmission rates based on network conditions to prevent congestion and maintain stability.
5. **Load Balancing:** Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple network paths or devices to evenly distribute the load and prevent bottlenecks, reducing the risk of congestion.
6. **Packet Discard Policies:** Implementing intelligent packet discard policies, such as Random Early Detection (RED) or Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED), allows routers to proactively drop packets before congestion occurs, avoiding network collapse.
7. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Feedback mechanisms, such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), enable network devices to signal congestion to endpoints, prompting them to adjust their transmission rates accordingly.
8. **Optimized Routing:** Efficient routing protocols, route optimization techniques, and traffic engineering strategies help optimize path selection and resource utilization, minimizing the likelihood of congestion along critical network paths.

### Question 21

#### a) Explain Distance Vector Routing with a suitable example.

**Distance Vector Routing:**
- Distance Vector Routing is a decentralized routing algorithm where each router maintains a routing table containing the distance (cost) and next-hop information to reach all destination networks.
- The router periodically exchanges routing updates with its neighboring routers, sharing its routing table information.
- Based on the received updates, a router recalculates its routing table by selecting the shortest path to each destination network using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

**Example:**
Consider a network with four routers (A, B, C, and D) interconnected as follows:

```
    A ----10---- B ----5---- C ----7---- D
```
- Initially, each router starts with its own routing table, listing directly connected networks with a distance of 0 and all other networks with an infinite distance.
- Routers exchange routing updates with their neighbors, sharing their routing table information.
- Based on the received updates, each router calculates the shortest path to reach each destination network and updates its routing table accordingly.
- This process continues iteratively until convergence, where routers no longer update their routing tables.

#### b) What is the purpose of subnetting? Find the netid and the hostid of the following IP addresses:
i) 19.34.21.5
ii) 220.34.8.9

**Purpose of Subnetting:**
- Subnetting allows a single network to be divided into smaller subnetworks, known as subnets, each identified by a unique subnet address.
- It helps optimize network performance, improve security, and facilitate efficient resource allocation by logically segmenting a larger network into smaller, more manageable units.

**Finding Netid and Hostid:**
i) For the IP address 19.34.21.5:
   - Netid: 19.34.21.0
   - Hostid: 0.0.0.5

ii) For the IP address 220.34.8.9:
   - Netid: 220.34.8.0
   - Hostid: 0.0.0.9

#### c) Define Broadcasting.

**Broadcasting:**
- Broadcasting is a communication method used in computer networks to send a message to all devices within the network.
- In a broadcast transmission, the sender transmits a single copy of the message, and network devices, such as routers or switches, replicate and forward the message to all connected devices.
- Broadcasting is commonly used for tasks such as service discovery, address resolution, or distributing network-wide announcements.
- However, excessive broadcasting can lead to network congestion and inefficiency, so it should be used judiciously.
