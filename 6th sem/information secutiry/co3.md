1. **How will you prevent your system from malwares? Discuss about any one type of malware.**

   Preventing malware involves a combination of best practices and security measures:

   - **Use Antivirus and Anti-malware Software:** Regularly update and run scans with reputable antivirus software.
   - **Regular Software Updates:** Ensure all operating systems, software, and applications are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords and consider implementing multi-factor authentication.
   - **Be Cautious with Email Attachments and Links:** Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links in unsolicited emails.
   - **Backup Data Regularly:** Regularly back up important data to mitigate the impact of a potential malware attack.

   **Example of Malware - Ransomware:**
   Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment to restore access. Prevention strategies include maintaining up-to-date backups, avoiding suspicious links and email attachments, keeping software up-to-date, and using robust security software that includes ransomware protection.

1. **Discuss the key components of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and explain how each component contributes to the overall resilience of an organization. Provide an example of how an organization might implement a BCP to handle a natural disaster scenario.**

   Key components of a BCP include:

   - **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Identifies critical business functions and the impact of a disruption. It helps prioritize resources and recovery efforts.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities, allowing the organization to address risks effectively.
   - **Recovery Strategies:** Defines the steps necessary to recover and restore business operations. These include data backup, alternate site operations, and recovery processes.
   - **Plan Development:** Documents the procedures and guidelines for response and recovery, ensuring all personnel know their roles and responsibilities.
   - **Testing and Exercises:** Regularly tests the plan to ensure its effectiveness and makes necessary updates based on lessons learned.
   - **Communication Plan:** Ensures clear communication channels during a crisis, both internally and externally.

   **Example Scenario - Natural Disaster:**
   In case of a natural disaster like a flood, the BCP would guide the organization in shifting critical operations to an alternate location, ensuring data backups are safe and accessible, and communicating with employees and stakeholders about the situation and recovery efforts. Regular drills and updates to the BCP would ensure that the organization can respond swiftly and effectively to minimize downtime and financial loss.

1. **Explain server-side vulnerability. List and discuss any 2 ways in which servers become vulnerable in an IT infrastructure.**

   Server-side vulnerability refers to weaknesses or flaws in a server that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. These vulnerabilities can compromise the security and functionality of the server and the data it hosts.

   **Two Ways Servers Become Vulnerable:**

   1. **Unpatched Software:**
      - **Explanation:** Servers running outdated software with known vulnerabilities are prime targets for attackers. These unpatched systems can be exploited through various means, such as buffer overflow attacks or SQL injection.
      - **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, and compromise sensitive data.

   2. **Misconfigured Server Settings:**
      - **Explanation:** Servers with misconfigured settings, such as open ports, default passwords, or overly permissive access controls, are vulnerable to attacks.
      - **Impact:** Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or launch further attacks within the network.
