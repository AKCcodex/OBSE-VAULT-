1. **Software Process vs. Methodology:**
   - A **software process** refers to a set of activities, methods, practices, and tools used to develop, maintain, and manage software systems throughout their lifecycle. It defines the sequence of steps to be followed, the roles and responsibilities of team members, and the artifacts to be produced during software development.
   - A **methodology**, on the other hand, is a broader framework or approach that guides the software development process. It encompasses principles, practices, and guidelines for organizing and managing the development effort. Methodologies provide a structured way of approaching software development but may not prescribe specific processes or techniques.
   - Example: The Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. Within the Agile methodology, various software processes such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP) define specific practices, ceremonies, and roles to implement Agile principles effectively.

3. **Major Phases in the Waterfall Model:**
   - The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, consisting of the following major phases:
     1. **Requirements Analysis:** In this phase, the project requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented in detail. The goal is to understand the scope of the project and define the functional and non-functional requirements.
     2. **System Design:** Once the requirements are defined, the system architecture and design are planned in this phase. This involves defining the overall system structure, interfaces, data flows, and algorithms to meet the specified requirements.
     3. **Implementation:** In the implementation phase, the system is developed based on the design specifications. Coding, testing, and integration of software modules are performed to build the complete system.
     4. **Testing:** The testing phase involves verifying and validating the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are conducted to identify and fix defects.
     5. **Deployment:** Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment for end-users to use. Installation, configuration, and user training may be part of this phase.
     6. **Maintenance:** The maintenance phase involves maintaining and supporting the software after deployment. This includes fixing defects, implementing enhancements, and providing technical support to users.

4. **"99% Complete" Syndrome:**
   - The "99% complete" syndrome refers to a situation in software development where a project appears to be almost complete, but the final completion and delivery are significantly delayed. It occurs due to underestimation of the effort required for the remaining tasks, lack of attention to detail, and overconfidence in progress.
   - Implications for Software Management:
     - It can lead to project delays, missed deadlines, and cost overruns.
     - It erodes stakeholder trust and confidence in the project team.
     - It highlights the importance of accurate project planning, monitoring, and risk management to prevent such situations.

5. **Comparison between Prototype Model and Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model:**
   - **Prototype Model:** In the Prototype Model, a basic version of the software system is quickly developed to gather feedback from users and stakeholders. It emphasizes early user involvement and iterative refinement of requirements.
   - **Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model:** RAD is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on rapid development and delivery of software. It involves a series of tightly integrated development cycles, with each cycle resulting in a prototype or working version of the software.
   - Scenarios:
     - Prototype Model: Suitable for projects where requirements are unclear or evolving, and user feedback is crucial for refining the design.
     - RAD Model: Ideal for projects with tight deadlines or where rapid delivery of functionality is required, such as developing prototypes for demonstration or proof-of-concept.

6. **Key Features of the Spiral Model:**
   - The Spiral Model is a risk-driven and iterative approach to software development that combines elements of both waterfall and iterative models. Its key features include:
     - **Risk Management:** The model emphasizes early identification and mitigation of project risks through iterative cycles of planning, analysis, development, and evaluation.
     - **Iterative Development:** The project progresses through multiple iterations or spirals, with each spiral representing a complete development cycle.
     - **Prototyping:** Prototyping is integrated into the model to gather user feedback and validate requirements before proceeding to full-scale development.
     - **Flexibility:** The model allows for flexibility in accommodating changes in requirements, technology, and project scope throughout the development process.

7. **Creating a Context Diagram for a Software System:**
   - A context diagram provides an overview of the system's scope, boundaries, and external interfaces. The process involves:
     1. **Identifying System Boundaries:** Determine the scope of the software system and define its external interfaces with other systems, users, and external entities.
     2. **Identifying External Entities:** Identify external entities that interact with the system, such as users, other systems, or external databases.
     3. **Defining Interactions:** Specify the interactions or data flows between the system and external entities, representing them as input/output arrows on the context diagram.
     4. **Creating the Diagram:** Use graphical notation to create the context diagram, with the system at the center and external entities connected through data flows.

   - Benefits:
     - Helps stakeholders understand the system's environment and interactions.
     - Provides a high-level view of the system's functionality and interfaces.
     - Guides the development of detailed requirements and design specifications.
